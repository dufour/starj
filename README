*J is a toolkit which serves two primary purposes:
    1) To facilitate the collection of dynamic execution data for Java programs
    2) To provide a framework for implementing analyses of this collected
      data quickly and easily

These two main goals are accomplished through the use of two separate tools:
    1) The *J profiling agent collects event trace data from a Java program
        running in a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) which implements the
        Java Virtual Machine Profiler Interface (JVMPI)
    2) The *J trace analyzer framework reads and analyzes the traces
        produced by the agent, using either a built-in analyses or custom ones.

To install *J on your system, please refer to the file named 'INSTALL'.
